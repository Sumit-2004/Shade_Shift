# Shade_Shift
This is a simple interactive webpage that allows users to dynamically change the background gradient by clicking buttons. Each button generates a random hex color and updates the background with a smooth linear gradient effect. The updated CSS code for the gradient is also displayed, making it easy to copy and use elsewhere.
